    <!--First paragraph-->
    <p>On the weekend of December 27 of 2025, I went to Universal Studios. It took <span id="time">7 hours</span> to arrive there from Oakland, CA. The price for parking was insane. The food there was pretty expensive also. I then went camping at Malibu Creek State Park Campgrounds. It was very cold and miserable. I had some good food there. It took about the same amount of time to drive back home. Overall, it was a very fun trip.</p>

    <!--Second paragraph-->
    <p><span id="answer">Yes, I would do it again.</span> I had a lot of fun including during the car ride there and back. I actually did some of the driving but it was boring because it was in the middle of nowhere. I enjoyed spending time with my family the most followed by the food. The biggest thing that was bad about the trip was the cold when we went camping. There was condensation on the camp when I woke up. </p>
